# If you are a developer

The code is avaliable and you can use it whatever purpose you have. Setup your own server with **issue analysis** project and understand how it works under the hood.

Our advice is to use virtualenv with django. So before you install requirments make sure you activated the env.

~~~~
$pip install virtualenv
virtualenv ENV_NAME
$source ENV_NAME/bin/activate
$git clone https://github.com/ValeryBaturin/issue_analysis
$pip install -r requirments.txt
$django manage.py runserver
